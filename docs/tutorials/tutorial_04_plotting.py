4. Plotting
===========
At the core of SciKit-GStat is a set of classes, that can be used interactively
to perform variogram analysis. One important aspect of this analysis is a rich
collection of plotting functions. These are directly available as class methods
of the :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>`,
:class:`DirectionalVariogram <skgstat.DirectionalVariogram>` and
:class:`SpaceTimeVariogram <skgstat.SpaceTimeVariogram>` method.
With version ``0.3.3``, SciKit-GStat implements two different plotting backend:
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `plotly <https://plotly.com/python/>`_.
Generally speaking, matplotlib is great for creating publication ready figures
in a variety of formats, including vector-graphic PDF files. Plotly, on the other
hand, will translate the figure into their Javascript library and open a webbrowser
with an interactive plot. This way you can obtain the same figure either for
your publication as PDF, or as a HTML object that can be injected into a
project report website.

With the newly introduced :mod:`skgstat.plotting` backend, you can easily read
and change the backend with a single convenient function. The default backend
is matplotlib. Please be aware, that `plotly` is only a soft dependency,
meaning you need to take care of the installation yourself, to keep
SciKit-GStat's dependency list shorter.

The data used to create the :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>` and
:class:`DirectionalVariogram <skgstat.DirectionalVariogram>` is from
Mälicke (2021). Here, pancake dataset is used.
The spatio-temporal data is derived from Fersch et al. (2020). From that data
publication, the wireless sensor network data is used. The originally published
15 minutes intervals soil temperature data at 20 cm depth was taken for all 55
stations and aggregated to mean hourly values. To further decrease the data size,
only every 6th data point is used here. Estimating the full data set will take
approx. 120GB RAM and processing took about 30 minutes. The results for the
thinned data sample are very comparable.

Both data samples can either be obtained by the original publications,
or from the SciKit-GStat documentation. Both samples are published under
Creative Commons BY 4.0 license. Please cite the original publications if you
use the data, and **not** SciKit-GStat.

# 4.2 Backend
# -----------
#
# You can switch to `plotly` as a plotting backend by calling the
# :mod:`plotting.backend` function and passing the name of the backend.
# Note that plotly is only a soft dependency and will not automatically be
# installed along with SciKit-GStat. You can install it like:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#   pip install plotly
#
# Note that in a Jupyter environment you might want to use the plotly.offline
# environment to embed the needed Javascript into the notebook. In these cases
# you have to catch the Figure object and use the iplot function from the
# offline submodule.

# to the experimental data. Further, you have to make sure that the statistical
# foundation of this estimation is sound, the lag classes are well designed and
# backed by a suiatable amount of data.
# Otherwise, any other geostatistical analysis or method will have to fail,
# no matter how nice the results might look like.
