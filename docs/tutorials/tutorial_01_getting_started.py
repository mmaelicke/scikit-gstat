1 - Getting Started
===================

The main application for :mod:`scikit-gstat <skgstat>` is variogram analysis and `Kriging <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging>`_.
This tutorial will guide you through the most basic functionality of ``scikit-gstat``.
There are other tutorials that will explain specific methods or attributes in ``scikit-gstat`` in more detail.

**What you will learn in this tutorial**

    * How to instantiate :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>` and :class:`OrdinaryKriging <skgstat.OrdinaryKriging>`
    * How to read a variogram
    * Perform an interpolation
    * Most basic plotting

# %%
# The module is called ``skgstat`` and by convention imported as ``skg``.
# The :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>` and :class:`OrdinaryKriging <skgstat.OrdinaryKriging>` classes are available at top level.
import skgstat as skg

# %%
# 1.1 Load data
# -------------
# SciKit-GStat includes a data submodule, that contains some sample datasets. It also offers some basic random sampling on data sources.
# Here we use the well-known Meuse dataset from the R package ``sp`` (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/st/index.html).
# If not specified different, the loading function will only export the lead measurements from the data source.
#
# **Note:** The data is distributed along with the package sp under a GPL-3 license.
# If you use the data, cite the original authors, not SciKit-GStat for the dataset.
src = skg.data.meuse()
print(src.get('origin'))

coords, vals = src.get('sample')
# make a nice table
pd.DataFrame({'x': coords[:, 0], 'y': coords[:, 1], 'lead': vals.flatten()}).head()

# %%
# Get a first overview of your data by plotting the `x` and `y` coordinates and visually inspect how the `z` spread out.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(9, 9))
art = ax.scatter(coords[:, 0], coords[:, 1], s=50, c=vals.flatten(), cmap='plasma')
plt.colorbar(art)

# %%
# We can already see a lot from here:
#
# * There are a few hot-spots, most of them aligned along the river-bank.
# * Most observations show rather low values
#
# These are already very important insights.
#
# 1.2 Build a Variogram
# ---------------------
# As a quick reminder, the variogram relates pair-wise separating distances of `coordinates` and relates them to the *semi-variance* of the corresponding `values` pairs. The default estimator used is the Matheron estimator:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \gamma (h) = \frac{1}{2N(h)} * \sum_{i=1}^{N(h)}(Z(x_i) - Z(x_{i + h}))^2
#
# For more details, please refer to the `User Guide <https://mmaelicke.github.io/scikit-gstat/userguide/variogram.html#experimental-variograms>`_.
#
# The :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>` class takes at least two arguments.
# The :func:`coordinates <skgstat.Variogram.coordinates>` and the :func:`values <skgstat.Variogram.values>` observed at these locations.
# If you use older versions, <ou should also at least set the ``normalize`` parameter to explicitly, as it changed it's default value in
# version `0.2.8` to ``False``. This attribute affects only the plotting, not the variogram values.
# Additionally, the number of bins is set to 15, because we have fairly many observations and the default value of 10 is unnecessarily small.
# The ``maxlag`` set the maximum distance for the last bin. As we have no other additional information about expected correlation lengths,
# we can either set nothing and use the full distance matrix, or set it i.e. to ``'median'``, which will restrict the distance matrix to only
# use half of all combinations.
V = skg.Variogram(coords, vals.flatten(), maxlag='median', n_lags=15, normalize=False)
fig = V.plot(show=False)

# %%
# The upper subplot show the histogram for the count of point-pairs in each lag class. You can see various things here:
#
#   * As expected, there is a clear spatial dependency, because semi-variance increases with distance (blue dots)
#   * The default `spherical` variogram model is well fitted to the experimental data
#   * The shape of the dependency is **not** captured quite well, but fair enough for this example
#   * The first two bins are not well captured, suggesting either the use of a nugget, or a different model.
#
# The sill of the variogram should correspond with the field variance. The field is unknown, but we can compare the sill to the *sample* variance:
print('Sample variance: %.2f   Variogram sill: %.2f' % (vals.flatten().var(), V.describe()['sill']))

# %%
# The ``describe`` method will return the most important parameters as a dictionary.
# And we can simply print the variogram ob,etc to the screen, to see all parameters.
pprint(V.describe())

# %%
# An even shorter summary is printed by the :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>` object itself:
print(V)

# %%
# 1.3 Kriging
# -----------
# The Kriging class will now use the Variogram from above to estimate the Kriging weights for each grid cell. This is done by solving a linear equation system. For an unobserved location $s_0$, we can use the distances to 5 observation points and build the system like:
#
# .. math::
#
#   \begin{pmatrix}
#   \gamma(s_1, s_1) & \gamma(s_1, s_2) & \gamma(s_1, s_3) & \gamma(s_1, s_4) & \gamma(s_1, s_5) & 1\\
#   \gamma(s_2, s_1) & \gamma(s_2, s_2) & \gamma(s_2, s_3) & \gamma(s_2, s_4) & \gamma(s_2, s_5) & 1\\
#   \gamma(s_3, s_1) & \gamma(s_3, s_2) & \gamma(s_3, s_3) & \gamma(s_3, s_4) & \gamma(s_3, s_5) & 1\\
#   \gamma(s_4, s_1) & \gamma(s_4, s_2) & \gamma(s_4, s_3) & \gamma(s_4, s_4) & \gamma(s_4, s_5) & 1\\
#   \gamma(s_5, s_1) & \gamma(s_5, s_2) & \gamma(s_5, s_3) & \gamma(s_5, s_4) & \gamma(s_5, s_5) & 1\\
#   1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
#   \end{pmatrix} *
#   \begin{bmatrix}
#   \lambda_1 \\
#   \lambda_2 \\
#   \lambda_3 \\
#   \lambda_4 \\
#   \lambda_5 \\
#   \mu \\
#   \end{bmatrix} =
#   \begin{pmatrix}
#   \gamma(s_0, s_1) \\
#   \gamma(s_0, s_2) \\
#   \gamma(s_0, s_3) \\
#   \gamma(s_0, s_4) \\
#   \gamma(s_0, s_5) \\
#   1 \\
#   \end{pmatrix}
#
# For more information, please refer to the `User Guide <https://mmaelicke.github.io/scikit-gstat/userguide/kriging.html#kriging-equation-system>`_.
#
# Consequently, the :class:`OrdinaryKriging <skgstat.OrdinaryKriging>` class needs a :class:`Variogram <skgstat.Variogram>`
# object as a mandatory attribute. Two very important optional attributes are ``min_points`` and ``max_points```.
# They will limit the size of the Kriging equation system. As we have 200 observations,
# we can require at least 5 neighbors within the range. More than 15 will only unnecessarily slow down the computation.
# The ``mode='exact'`` attribute will advise the class to build and solve the system above for each location.
#
# **Note:** The recommended way for kriging applications is to use the interface to :any:`gstools`.
# There is an easy-to-use interface via :func:`Variogram.to_gstools <skgstat.Variogram.to_gstools>`
# and :func:`Variogram.to_gs_krige <skgstat.Variogram.to_gs_krige>`.
# The getting started tutorial will use the builtin kriging class, anyway.
ok = skg.OrdinaryKriging(V, min_points=5, max_points=15, mode='exact')

# %%
# The :func:`OrdinaryKriging.transform <skgstat.OrdianryKriging.transform>` method will apply the interpolation for passed arrays of coordinates.
# It requires each dimension as a single 1D array. We can easily build a meshgrid of 100x100 coordinates and pass them to the interpolator.
# To receive a 2D result, we can simply reshape the result. The Kriging error will be available as the ``sigma`` attribute of the interpolator.

# build the target grid
x = coords[:, 0]
y = coords[:, 1]
xx, yy = np.mgrid[x.min():x.max():100j, y.min():y.max():100j]
field = ok.transform(xx.flatten(), yy.flatten()).reshape(xx.shape)
s2 = ok.sigma.reshape(xx.shape)

# %%
# And finally, we can plot the result.
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8))

# rescale the coordinates to fit the interpolation raster
x_ = (x - x.min()) / (x.max() - x.min()) * 100
y_ = (y - y.min()) / (y.max() - y.min()) * 100

art = axes[0].matshow(field.T, origin='lower', cmap='plasma', vmin=vals.min(), vmax=vals.max())
axes[0].set_title('Interpolation')
axes[0].plot(x_, y_, '+w')
axes[0].set_xlim((0, 100))
axes[0].set_ylim((0, 100))
plt.colorbar(art, ax=axes[0])
art = axes[1].matshow(s2.T, origin='lower', cmap='YlGn_r')
axes[1].set_title('Kriging Error')
plt.colorbar(art, ax=axes[1])
axes[1].plot(x_, y_, '+w')
axes[1].set_xlim((0, 100))
axes[1].set_ylim((0, 100))

# %%
# From the Kriging error map, you can see how the interpolation is very certain close to the observation points,
# but rather high in areas with only little coverage. You could now define a threshold of maximum accepted Kriging error
# variance to mask the interpolation result.
