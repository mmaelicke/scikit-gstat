7. Maximum Likelihood fit
=========================

Since version ``0.6.12`` SciKit-GStat implements an utility function factory
which takes a Variogram instance and builds up a (negative) maximum likelihood
function for the associated sample, distance matrix and model type.
The used function is defined in eq. 14 from Lark (2000). Eq. 16 from same
publication was adapted to all available theoretical models available in
SciKit-GStat, with the exception of the harmonized model, which
does not require a fitting.

This tutorial helps you to build your own maximum likelihood approximation
for use in your geostatistical application. Note that SciKit-GStat is build
around the method of moments and does not support maximum likelihood beyond
the approach presented here.

# Maximum likelihood using SciKit-GStat
# -------------------------------------
# First step to perform the fitting is to make initial guesses for the parameters.
# Here, we take the mean separating distance for the effective range, the sample
# variance for the sill and 10% of the sample variance for the nugget.
# To improve performance and runtime, we also define a boundary to restrict
# the parameter space.

# base initial guess on separating distance and sample variance

# Next step is to pass the Variogram instance to the function factory.
# We find optimal parameters by minimizing the returned negative
# log-likelihood function. Please refer to SciPy's minimize function to learn
# about attributes. The returned function from the utility suite is built with
# SciPy in mind, as the function signature complies to SciPy's interface and,
# thus can just be passed to the minimize function.
# Here, we pass the initial guess, the bounds and set the solver method to
# SLSQP, a suitable solver for bounded optimization.
