This file collects different functions for estimating the semivariance of a group of values. These functions
can be used to fit a experimental variogram to a list of points. Each of the given functions just calculate
the estimate for one bin. If you want a Variogram, use the variogram functions or Class from the Variogram and vario
submodule, or order the bins yourself

def matheron(x):
    r"""Matheron Semi-Variance

    Calculates the Matheron Semi-Variance from an array of pairwise differences.
    Returns the semi-variance for the whole array. In case a semi-variance is
    needed for multiple groups, this function has to be mapped on each group.
    That is the typical use case in geostatistics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : numpy.ndarray
        Array of pairwise differences. These values should be the distances
        between pairwise observations in value space. If xi and x[i+h] fall
        into the h separating distance class, x should contain abs(xi - x[i+h])
        as an element.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.float64

    Notes
    -----

    This implementation follows the original publication [1]_ and the
    notes on their application [2]_. Following the 1962 publication [1]_,
    the semi-variance is calculated as:

    .. math::
        \gamma (h) = \frac{1}{2N(h)} * \sum_{i=1}^{N(h)}(x)^2

    with:

    .. math::
        x = Z(x_i) - Z(x_{i+h})

    where x is exactly the input array x.

def genton(x):
    r""" Genton robust semi-variance estimator

    Return the Genton semi-variance of the given sample x. Genton is a highly
    robust varigram estimator, that is designed to be location free and
    robust on extreme values in x.
    Genton is based on calculating kth order statistics and will for large
    data sets be close or equal to the 25% quartile of all ordered point pairs
    in X.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : numpy.ndarray
        Array of pairwise differences. These values should be the distances
        between pairwise observations in value space. If xi and x[i+h] fall
        into the h separating distance class, x should contain abs(xi - x[i+h])
        as an element.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.float64

    Notes
    -----
    The Genton estimator is described in great detail in the original
    publication [5]_ and is defined as:

    .. math:: Q_{N_h} = 2.2191\{|V_i(h) - V_j(h)|; i < j\}_{(k)}

    and

     .. math:: k = \binom{[N_h / 2] + 1}{2}

     and

     .. math:: q = \binom{N_h}{2}

     where k is the kth quantile of all q point pairs. For large N (k/q) will be
     close to 0.25. For N >= 500, (k/q) is close to 0.25 by two decimals and
     will therefore be set to 0.5 and the two binomial coefficients k,
     q are not calculated.
