        Directional Variogram. The calculation is not performant and not
        tested yet.

        Parameters
        ----------
        coordinates : numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (m, n). Will be used as m observation points of
            n-dimensions. This variogram can be calculated on 1 - n
            dimensional coordinates. In case a 1-dimensional array is passed,
            a second array of same length containing only zeros will be
            stacked to the passed one.
        values : numpy.ndarray
            Array of values observed at the given coordinates. The length of
            the values array has to match the m dimension of the coordinates
            array. Will be used to calculate the dependent variable of the
            variogram.
        estimator : str, callable
            String identifying the semi-variance estimator to be used.
            Defaults to the Matheron estimator. Possible values are:

              * matheron        [Matheron, default]
              * cressie         [Cressie-Hawkins]
              * dowd            [Dowd-Estimator]
              * genton          [Genton]
              * minmax          [MinMax Scaler]
              * entropy         [Shannon Entropy]

            If a callable is passed, it has to accept an array of absolute
            differences, aligned to the 1D distance matrix (flattened upper
            triangle) and return a scalar, that converges towards small
            values for similarity (high covariance).
        model : str
            String identifying the theoretical variogram function to be used
            to describe the experimental variogram. Can be one of:

              * spherical       [Spherical, default]
              * exponential     [Exponential]
              * gaussian        [Gaussian]
              * cubic           [Cubic]
              * stable          [Stable model]
              * matern          [Matérn model]
              * nugget          [nugget effect variogram]

        dist_func : str
            String identifying the distance function. Defaults to
            'euclidean'. Can be any metric accepted by
            scipy.spatial.distance.pdist. Additional parameters are not (yet)
            passed through to pdist. These are accepted by pdist for some of
            the metrics. In these cases the default values are used.
        bin_func : str
            .. versionchanged:: 0.3.8
                added 'fd', 'sturges', 'scott', 'sqrt', 'doane'

            String identifying the binning function used to find lag class
            edges. All methods calculate bin edges on the interval [0, maxlag[.
            Possible values are:

                * `'even'` (default) finds `n_lags` same width bins
                * `'uniform'` forms `n_lags` bins of same data count
                * `'fd'` applies Freedman-Diaconis estimator to find `n_lags`
                * `'sturges'` applies Sturge's rule to find `n_lags`.
                * `'scott'` applies Scott's rule to find `n_lags`
                * `'doane'` applies Doane's extension to Sturge's rule to find `n_lags`
                * `'sqrt'` uses the square-root of :func:`distance <skgstat.Variogram.distance>`. as `n_lags`.

            More details are given in the documentation for :func:`set_bin_func <skgstat.Variogram.set_bin_func>`.
        normalize : bool
            Defaults to False. If True, the independent and dependent
            variable will be normalized to the range [0,1].
        fit_method : str
            String identifying the method to be used for fitting the
            theoretical variogram function to the experimental. More info is
            given in the Variogram.fit docs. Can be one of:

                * 'lm': Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for unconstrained
                  problems. This is the faster algorithm, yet is the fitting of
                  a variogram not unconstrianed.
                * 'trf': Trust Region Reflective function for non-linear
                  constrained problems. The class will set the boundaries
                  itself. This is the default function.

        fit_sigma : numpy.ndarray, str
            Defaults to None. The sigma is used as measure of uncertainty
            during variogram fit. If fit_sigma is an array, it has to hold
            n_lags elements, giving the uncertainty for all lags classes. If
            fit_sigma is None (default), it will give no weight to any lag.
            Higher values indicate higher uncertainty and will lower the
            influcence of the corresponding lag class for the fit.
            If fit_sigma is a string, a pre-defined function of separating
            distance will be used to fill the array. Can be one of:

                * 'linear': Linear loss with distance. Small bins will have
                  higher impact.
                * 'exp': The weights decrease by a e-function of distance
                * 'sqrt': The weights decrease by the squareroot of distance
                * 'sq': The weights decrease by the squared distance.

            More info is given in the Variogram.fit_sigma documentation.
        directional_model : string, function
            The model used for selecting all points fulfilling the
            directional constraint of the Variogram. A predefined
            model can be selected by passing the model name as string.
            Optionally a callable accepting the difference vectors
            between points in polar form as angles and distances and
            returning a mask array can be passed. In this case, the
            azimuth, tolerance and bandwidth has to be incorporated by
            hand into the model.

                * 'compass': includes points in the direction of the
                  azimuth at given tolerance. The bandwidth parameter will be
                  ignored.
                * 'triangle': constructs a triangle with an angle of
                  tolerance at the point of interest and union an rectangle
                  parallel to azimuth, once the hypotenuse length reaches
                  bandwidth.
                * 'circle': constructs a half circle touching the point of
                  interest, dislocating the center at the distance of
                  bandwidth in the direction of azimuth. The half circle is
                  union with an rectangle parallel to azimuth.

            Visual representations, usage hints and implementation specifics
            are given in the documentation.
        azimuth : float
            The azimuth of the directional dependence for this Variogram,
            given as an angle in **degree**. The East of the coordinate
            plane is set to be at 0° and is counted clockwise to 180° and
            counter-clockwise to -180°. Only Points lying in the azimuth of a
            specific point will be used for forming point pairs.
        tolerance : float
            The tolerance is given as an angle in **degree**- Points being
            dislocated from the exact azimuth by half the tolerance will be
            accepted as well. It's half the tolerance as the point may be
            dislocated in the positive and negative direction from the azimuth.
        bandwidth : float
            Maximum tolerance acceptable in **coordinate units**, which is
            usually meter. Points at higher distances may be far dislocated
            from the azimuth in terms of coordinate distance, as the
            tolerance is defined as an angle. THe bandwidth defines a maximum
            width for the search window. It will be perpendicular to and
            bisected by the azimuth.
        use_nugget : bool
            Defaults to False. If True, a nugget effet will be added to all
            Variogram.models as a third (or fourth) fitting parameter. A
            nugget is essentially the y-axis interception of the theoretical
            variogram function.
        maxlag : float, str
            Can specify the maximum lag distance directly by giving a value
            larger than 1. The binning function will not find any lag class
            with an edge larger than maxlag. If 0 < maxlag < 1, then maxlag
            is relative and maxlag * max(Variogram.distance) will be used.
            In case maxlag is a string it has to be one of 'median', 'mean'.
            Then the median or mean of all Variogram.distance will be used.
            Note maxlag=0.5 will use half the maximum separating distance,
            this is not the same as 'median', which is the median of all
            separating distances
        n_lags : int
            Specify the number of lag classes to be defined by the binning
            function.
        verbose : bool
            Set the Verbosity of the class. Not Implemented yet.

        * 'compass': includes points in the direction of the azimuth at given
